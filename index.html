      <h1> AP Portfolio </h1>
      <er> Hello and welcome to my AP computer science portfolio. The entirety of this webpage has two main focuses: 1)a venue to watch me progress as a programmer 2)give live documentation along the way.</er>
      <h2>Brief Overview of Class</h2>
      <p style="color:white;">"Whether it’s 3-D animation, engineering, music, app development, medicine, visual design, robotics, or political analysis, computer science is the engine that powers the technology, productivity, and innovation that drive the world. Computer science experience has become imperative for students’ success in the workforce of tomorrow."</p>
      <er> AP Computer Science Principles is a project-based class where students are first introduced to computer programming and other broad entities involved in the world of computer science. The class begins with block-based programming and progressively steps up within high level programming languages such as Python 2.7. Overall the class works in a pair-programming setting, where students can rely on one another for comprehension and correction with different concepts along the way.</er>
