      <h2>About me</h2>
    <center><p1>Hello my name is Raymond and I am a type A personality. I enjoy studying math and physics. I desire to get into a form of engineering as a career path. Computers prove to both interest me time and time again, so much in fact it is the reason I joined this course. I wish to have a better understanding of the devices I use every day, and I want to have a greater appreciation for the time and effort developers put into them.</p1>
